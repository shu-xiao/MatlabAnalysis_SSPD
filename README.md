# MatlabAnalysis_SSPD
The analysis code is written in Matlab (.m file).
The main ananlysis code is listed in the following. The other files are test codes or generated by Matlab.
## Dependency
* Install MatLab Add-On [ConvertTDMS (v10)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44206-converttdms-v10) and add it to the path of MatLab environment.

Although MatLab has the built-in function to handle it, We use this package for backward compatibility for [rename_file_TDMS_convert_Chatgpt.m](rename_file_TDMS_convert_Chatgpt.m).
## Analysis Steps
1. Run [rename_file_TDMS_convert_Chatgpt.m](rename_file_TDMS_convert_Chatgpt.m).  Convert TDMS file to text file.
2. Run [SMSPD_waveform_plot_ChatGPT.m](SMSPD_waveform_plot_ChatGPT.m) (Optional). Check to waveform of data.
3. Run [SMSPD_ana_for_eff_time_jitter_tdms_chatGPT.m](SMSPD_ana_for_eff_time_jitter_tdms_chatGPT.m). Generate some plot and the efficiencies of SSPD.
   * You need to edit the analysis parameters by yourself. It depends on the measurement condition.
